[{"title": "Optimal Brassicaceae family microgreens from a phytochemical and sensory perspective.", "pmid": "39160037", "abstract": "Microgreens, also called superfoods, emerge because of their high levels of nutrients, diverse flavour profiles, and sustainable cultivation methods, which make them culinary delights and valuable to a healthy and flavorful diet. The present study investigated Brassicaceae family microgreens, proposing a novel system (quality indices) that allows scoring among them. Fourteen Brassica microgreen species were morphological, phytochemical, and sensorial investigated. The morphological assessment revealed that radish microgreens exhibited the highest leaf area (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while red mizuna demonstrated superior yield. Cauliflower microgreens contained the highest concentrations of ascorbic acid (HPLC-DAD) and total phenolic content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Phytochemical analysis using HPLC-MS/MS identified over 18 glucosinolates and phenolic compounds. Red mustard and red cabbage showed the highest glucosinolate content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Watercress exhibited the highest phenolic compound content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), primarily flavonoids, while broccoli and radish contained the highest isothiocyanate levels. Cauliflower microgreens resulted in the most consumer-accepted variety. Appling quality indices scoring system identified radish, cauliflower, and broccoli microgreens as the most promising species. This study underscores the potential of Brassica microgreens as an excellent source of health-promoting phytochemicals with favorable market acceptance, providing valuable insights for both nutritional research and commercial applications.", "doi": "10.1016/j.foodres.2024.114812"}]
