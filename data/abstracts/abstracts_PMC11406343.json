        "abstract": "Three commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with low, medium, and high H2S-producing capacity were chosen to investigate the effect of yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) levels and composition on volatile compounds in a chemically defined medium, specifically high, medium, and low initial YAN levels with varying proportions of DAP or sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine). The results revealed that the initial YAN containing a larger proportion of diammonium phosphate resulted in a higher YAN consumption rate during the early stages of fermentation. The yeast strain had a greater effect on the volatiles than the YAN level and composition. Keeping the total YAN constant, a higher proportion of sulfur-containing amino acids resulted in a considerably higher production of 3-methylthiopropanol. The sensory impact of three key volatile sulfur compounds was investigated in a Chardonnay wine matrix, indicating that 3-methylthiopropanol at subthreshold or greater concentrations was effective in enhancing the cantaloupe aroma.",
