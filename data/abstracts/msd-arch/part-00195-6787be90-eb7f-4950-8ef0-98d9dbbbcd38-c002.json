In addition, sera were tested in a masked fashion for anti-RA33 antibodies in a total of 60 patients: 10 with EA and 50 age-, sex- and ethnically matched controls. Ten of 200 (5%) patients with SLE, mainly non-white women, had EA. There were trends for increased renal involvement (P = 0.06), SjÃ¶gren's syndrome (P = 0.07) and Raynaud's phenomenon (P = 0.03) in patients with EA compared to those without EA. Rheumatoid factor (RF) was increased in patients with EA (P < 0.02), as were antibodies to double-stranded DNA (P < 0.05), Sm (P < 0.01) and La/SS-B (P < 0.001). Anti-RA33 antibodies were present in 70% with EA compared to 28% without EA (P < 0.05). RF correlated with anti-RA33 antibodies in patients with EA, but not with the presence of anti-RA33 alone. Thus, anti-RA33 antibodies may identify those patients with SLE who are at risk for EA, and an association with RF suggests a common immune response or pathological mechanism in autoimmune erosive joint disease.","doi":"10.1093/rheumatology/37.4.421","pmid":"9619894"}

Immunoblot analysis of OLV-2-infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants showed that the 36K protein accumulated in the early stages of infection and was associated with a subcellular fraction enriched in cytoplasmic membranes. In infected cells there were tubular structures, some containing virus-like particles, scattered in the cytoplasm or protruding from or penetrating the cell wall at the plasmodesmata. Immunogold labelling localized the 36K protein in the plasmodesmata of OLV-2-infected cells and showed it to be associated with virus-containing tubules. Leaf trichome cells of N. tabacum plants, transformed with a 36K-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion construct, revealed localized fluorescence in the cell walls, possibly due to association of the fusion protein with plasmodesmata. When the same 36K-GFP fusion protein was expressed in N. tabacum protoplasts, long tubular fluorescent structures protruded from the protoplast surface, suggesting that the 36K protein is responsible for tubule induction. The conclusion is drawn that this protein is likely to be the OLV-2 movement protein, mediating cell-to-cell virus movement, and that movement is by a tubule-guided mechanism.","doi":"10.1099/0022-1317-80-5-1103","pmid":"10355755"}
{"title":"Posttranscriptional regulation of ferritin during nodule development in soybean.","abstract":"During soybean (Glycine max) nodule development, induced ferritin mRNA concentration remains elevated while the protein concentration decreases 4- to 5-fold (M. Ragland and E.C. Theil [1993] Plant Mol Biol 21: 555-560). Investigation of posttranscriptional regulation of nodule ferritin during development showed that ferritin mRNA was efficiently translated based on polyribosome size in vivo, protein synthesis (0.8% of total protein) in vitro, and protein synthesis in intact nodules. Ferritin, a plastid protein, was processed in both immature and mature nodules. In chimeric mRNA, soybean ferritin mRNA sequences blocked the function of the iron regulatory element (IRE), the cis regulatory element of animal ferritin mRNA; the IRE regulates chimeric animal mRNAs. The absence of translational regulation of ferritin in plants contrasts with ferritin regulation in animals. Thus, ferritin regulation has diverged during evolution, whereas structure of the mature protein has been conserved. Ferritin in mature soybean nodules is apparently regulated after translation, possibly in analogy with such plastid proteins as chlorophyll-binding proteins D1, CP43, LHCI, and LHCII, the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, and apoplastocyanin. An autocatalytic mechanism observed in vivo for degradation of plastid protein D1 and in vitro for pea ferritin during iron release could explain the ferritin decreases in mature nodules.","doi":"10.1104/pp.104.1.263","pmid":"8115547"}

Footprinting, deletion, and point mutation analyses revealed different binding properties for all three factors and further showed that even single base pair substitutions had a dramatic effect on binding affinity. The LAT1 and NAT1 factors were released from chromatin by extraction with a low-salt buffer and were soluble in 2% trichloroacetic acid, implying a relationship to high-mobility group (HMG) proteins.

These ineffective, nitrogen non-fixing pseudonodules were disturbed at a very early step of bacteroid and nodule development. Subsequent cloning and sequencing of the DNA region mutated in strain 3160 revealed that the Tn5 insertion mapped in a gene that had 60% homology to the Escherichia coli glyA gene coding for serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT; E.C.2.1.2.1.). SHMT catalyses the biosynthesis of glycine from serine and the transfer of a one-carbon unit to tetrahydrofolate. The B. japonicum glyA region was able to fully complement the glycine auxotrophy of an E. coli glyA deletion strain. Although the Tn5 insertion in B. japonicum mutant 3160 disrupted the glyA coding sequence, this strain was only a bradytroph (i.e. a leaky auxotroph). Thus, B. japonicum may have an additional pathway for glycine biosynthesis. Nevertheless, the glyA mutation was responsible for the drastic symbiotic phenotype visible on plants. It may be possible, therefore, that a sufficient supply with glycine and/or a functioning C1-metabolism are indispensable for the establishment of a fully effective, nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-2958.1991.tb01824.x","pmid":"2014004","reference_id":"7600314"}
{"title":"Transgenic tobacco plants expressing yeast-derived invertase in either the cytosol, vacuole or apoplast: a powerful tool for studying sucrose metabolism and sink/source interactions.","abstract":"In higher plants sucrose plays a central roles with respect to both short-term storage and distribution of photoassimilates formed in the leaf. Sucrose is synthesized in the cytosol, transiently stored in the vacuole and exported via the apoplast. In order to elucidate the role of the different compartments with respect to sucrose metabolism, a yeast-derived invertase was directed into the cytosol and vacuole of transgenic tobacco plants. This was in addition to the targeting of yeast-derived invertase into the apoplast described previously. Vacuolar targeting was achieved by fusing an N-terminal portion (146 amino acids long) of the vacuolar protein patatin to the coding region of the mature invertase protein. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing the yeast-derived invertase in different subcellular compartments displayed dramatic phenotypic differences when compared to wild-type plants. All transgenic plants showed stunted growth accompanied by reduced root formation. Starch and soluble sugars accumulated in leaves indicating that the distribution of sucrose was impaired in all cases. Expression of cytosolic yeast invertase resulted in the accumulation of starch and soluble sugars in both very young (sink) and older (source) leaves. The leaves were curved, indicating a more rapid cell expansion or cell division at the upper side of the leaf. Light-green sectors with reduced photosynthetic activity were evenly distributed over the leaf surface. With the apoplastic and vacuolar invertase, the phenotypical changes induced only appear in older (source) leaves. The development of bleached and/or necrotic sectors was linked to the source state of a leaf. Bleaching followed the sink to source transition, starting at the rim of the leaf and moving to the base. The bleaching was paralleled by the inhibition of photosynthesis.","doi":"10.1111/j.1365-313x.1991.00095.x","pmid":"1844880"}

Probing with a fragment of the lectin gene [Vodkin, L. O., Rhodes, P. R. & Goldberg, R. B. (1983) Cell 34, 1023-1031] afforded a clone of 1012 nucleotides containing the complete coding region of 858 nucleotides for the precursor to soybean agglutinin. The deduced amino acid sequence contains the 253 residues of the mature lectin and an hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide of 32 amino acids. Expression in Escherichia coli of the cDNA coding for the precursor to the lectin or for the mature lectin led to the accumulation of large quantities of inclusion bodies, from which mature SBA was isolated in small yield (up to 1 mg/l). It was identical with the native lectin in the hemagglutinating activity and carbohydrate specificity, N-terminal sequence and oligomeric structure, but, because it was not glycosylated, its subunit mass was lower by 2 kDa. Our findings show that pre-SBA is processed into the mature form in the bacteria, and that, contrary to what has been suggested [Nagai, K. & Yamaguchi, H. (1993) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 113, 123-125], glycosylation is not essential for the folding of the lectin, nor for its subunit assembly into a biologically active tetramer. To obtain recombinant SBA in secreted form, the pre-SBA cDNA was subcloned in pTM1 vector and the construct inserted into vaccinia virus. When monkey BS-C-1 cells were infected by the virus, using a double expression protocol, recombinant lectin was secreted into the growth medium, from which it was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography at a yield similar to that from the bacteria. Except for its lower hemagglutinating activity, the product was indistinguishable from native SBA in all properties tested. It was also susceptible to digestion by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H or N-glycanase which caused a decrease of 2 kDa in its subunit mass and gave the same results on lectin blot analysis, indicating that it too is a glycoprotein with a single oligomannose unit.","doi":"10.1111/j.1432-1033.1997.t01-3-00684.x","pmid":"9395314"}

However, pineal dihydrobiopterin and/or biopterin (10-15% of total biopterin) was increased by methotrexate up to 2.5-fold. Biopterin detected in the culture medium following pineal culture was also increased to a similar extent after methotrexate treatment and appeared to represent leakage of pineal dihydrobiopterin and/or biopterin. Culture of glands in 5 microM methotrexate did not alter the conversion of [U-14C]-guanosine to [14C]biopterin, suggesting that pineal tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis was not altered by methotrexate. Complete inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase activity measured in pineal homogenates was obtained following culture of glands in all concentrations of methotrexate studied.

{"title":"Infection of epithelial cells by pathogenic neisseriae reduces the levels of multiple lysosomal constituents.","abstract":"Members of our group reported recently that neisseria infection of human epithelial cells results in accelerated degradation of the major lysosomal integral membrane protein LAMP1 and that this is due to hydrolysis of this glycoprotein at its immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1)-like hinge by the neisseria type 2 IgA1 protease (L. Lin et al., Mol. Microbiol. 24:1083-1094, 1997). We also reported that the IgA1 protease plays a major role in the ability of the pathogenic neisseriae to survive within epithelial cells and hypothesized that this is due to alteration of lysosomes as a result of protease-mediated LAMP1 degradation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that neisseria infection leads to multiple changes in lysosomes. Here, we report that neisseria infection also reduces the levels of three other lysosomal markers: LAMP2, lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP), and CD63. In contrast, neither the epidermal growth factor receptor level nor the beta-tubulin level is affected. A detailed examination of LAMP2 indicated that the reduced LAMP2 levels are not the result of an altered biosynthetic rate or of cleavage by the IgA1 protease. Nevertheless, the protease plays a role in reducing LAMP2 and LAP activity levels, as these are partially restored in cells infected with an iga mutant. We conclude that neisseria infection results in multiple changes to the lysosomes of infected epithelial cells and that these changes are likely an indirect result of IgA1 protease-mediated cleavage of LAMP1.","doi":"10.1128/IAI.66.10.5001-5007.1998","pmid":"9746610"}

Nuclear import of Yrb1 is a facilitated process that requires a short basic sequence within the Ran-binding domain (RBD).

When metabolic alterations were seen in response to the separate exposures, they were seen only after a phagocytic challenge to the macrophage and not when the cell was unchallenged.

The USE is a highly conserved plant snRNA gene-specific element, and its distance from the -30 TATA box, corresponding to approximately three and four helical DNA turns in Pol III and Pol II genes, respectively, is crucial for determining RNA Pol specificity of transcription. Sequences upstream of the USE play no role in snRNA gene transcription in dicot plants. Here we show that for expression of snRNA genes in maize, a monocotyledonous plant, the USE and TATA elements are essential, but not sufficient, for transcription. Efficient expression of both Pol II- and Pol III-specific snRNA genes in transfected maize protoplasts requires an additional element(s) positioned upstream of the USE. This element, named MSP (for monocot-specific promoter; consensus, RGCCCR), is present in one to three copies in monocot snRNA genes and is interchangeable between Pol II- and Pol III-specific genes. The efficiency of snRNA gene expression in maize protoplast is determined primarily by the strength of the MSP element(s); this contrasts with the situation in protoplasts of a dicot plant, Nicotiana plumbaginifolia, where promoter strength is a function of the quality of the USE element. Interestingly, the organization of monocot Pol III-specific snRNA gene promoters closely resembles those of equivalent vertebrate promoters.

The functional effect of phosphorylation was demonstrated using an in vitro motility assay in which unphosphorylated calponin (2 microM) caused a profound inhibition of actin sliding. Calponin phosphorylated by PKC did not inhibit actin sliding. The results show that phosphorylation of calponin occurs in intact tracheal smooth muscle and that phosphorylation of calponin in vitro alleviates the inhibitory effect of calponin on actomyosin function.","doi":"10.1152/ajplung.1997.272.1.L115","pmid":"9038910"}
{"title":"Safety, tolerance and pharmacokinetics of 2.0 g cefpirome (HR 810) after single and multiple dosing.","abstract":"After intravenous injection of a single dose of 2.0 g cefpirome (HR 810) and multiple doses of 2.0 g b.i.d. (11 doses) to 10 healthy male volunteers in an open design, concentrations of unchanged drug were measured at various times in serum and urine over 24 and 96 h, respectively. Cefpirome concentrations were determined using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The biological half-life (t1/2, beta) found by fitting a two-compartment open model to the data was 2 h. No accumulation of the serum levels could be detected during the multiple-dose phase. Urinary concentrations of unchanged cefpirome effective against most clinically relevant bacteria were detected for at least 36 h. The drug was safe and well tolerated. No drug-related changes were observed for blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, haematology, clinical chemistry or urinalysis, including beta 2-microglobulin in serum and creatinine clearance.","doi":"10.1159/000238594","pmid":"3180904"}
{"title":"Linear IgA disease: cylindroma demonstrates heterogeneity of the target antigens.","abstract":"Serum from 58 patients with linear IgA disease was tested by indirect immunofluorescence on the novel substrate cylindroma, which produces an abundance of basement membrane components. The use of split skin and of cylindroma has identified 2 target antigens. The majority of patients have a target antigen associated with epidermal cells and similar in distribution on cylindroma to hemidesmosome proteins. A minority have a dermal antigen with the distribution of collagen VII on cylindroma. These data support the hypothesis that linear IgA disease is a heterogeneous disease with regard to the target antigens.","doi":"10.1159/000246944","pmid":"8049543","reference_id":"27315061"}
{"title":"Oral phenylalanine loading in dopa-responsive dystonia: a possible diagnostic test.","abstract":"To determine if there is abnormal phenylalanine and biopterin metabolism in patients with dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), we measured plasma levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, biopterin, and neopterin at baseline, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after an oral phenylalanine load (100 mg/kg). Seven adults with DRD, two severely affected children with DRD, and nine adult controls were studied. All patients had phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations within the normal range at baseline. In the adult patients, phenylalanine levels were higher than in controls at 2, 4, and 6 hours post-load (p < 0.0005); tyrosine concentrations were lower than control levels at 1, 2, and 4 hours post-load (p < 0.05). Phenylalanine to tyrosine ratios were elevated in patients at all times post-load (p < 0.0005). Biopterin levels in the patients were decreased at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 hours post-load (p < 0.005). Pretreatment with tetrahydrobiopterin (7.5 mg/kg) normalized phenylalanine and tyrosine profiles in two adult patients. In the children with DRD, phenylalanine to tyrosine ratios were slightly elevated at baseline. Following phenylalanine loading, the phenylalanine profiles were similar to those seen in the adult patients but there was no elevation in plasma tyrosine. Baseline biopterin levels were lower in the children with DRD than in the adult patients or the controls and there was no increase in biopterin post-load. In both the children and adults with DRD, neopterin concentrations did not differ from control values at baseline or after phenylalanine load. The results are consistent with decreased liver phenylalanine hydroxylase activity due to defective synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin in patients with DRD. The findings show that a phenylalanine load may be useful in the diagnosis of this disorder.","doi":"10.1212/wnl.48.5.1290","pmid":"9153460"}
{"title":"California's tobacco tax initiative: the development and passage of Proposition 99.","abstract":"In this case study, we describe and analyze the development and passage of California's tobacco tax initiative, Proposition 99, the Tobacco Tax and Health Promotion Act of 1988. We gathered information from published reports, public documents, personal correspondence, internal memorandums, polling data, and interviews with representatives from organizations that participated in the Proposition 99 campaign. Proposition 99 passed as a result of the efforts of a coalition of voluntary health agencies, medical organizations, and environmental groups. They organized a long-term effort by conducting essential polling, planning strategies, gaining media exposure, developing a coalition, and running a successful campaign to enact the tax by shifting the venue from legislative to initiative politics. To build the coalition that was needed to pass Proposition 99, public health proponents enlisted the help of medical organizations in exchange for additional revenue to be allocated to medical services. By shifting the venue from the legislature to the general public, advocates capitalized on public concern about tobacco and for youth and took advantage of the tobacco industry's low credibility. The passage of Proposition 99, despite a massive campaign against it by the tobacco industry, represents a milestone in the tobacco control and public health fields. From its passage in 1988 through 1993, tobacco use in California declined by 27 percent, which is three times faster than the United States average. As a result, Proposition 99 has served as a national model for other states and the federal government. Although allocation of tobacco tax revenues specifically to health education and prevention was a primary goal during the development and passage of Proposition 99, when the venue shifted back to the legislature for implementation, medical organizations successfully advocated illegal diversions of Proposition 99 tobacco control and research funds to medical services. Organizations seeking to enact Proposition 99-like tobacco tax increases must be prepared to mount aggressive campaigns to pass the initiative in the face of major tobacco industry opposition and then must continue to work to protect the program after passage by voters.","doi":"10.1215/03616878-21-3-543","pmid":"8784688"}
