        "title": "Recent advances in dietary polyphenols (DPs): antioxidant activities, nutrient interactions, delivery systems, and potential applications",
        "abstract": "Dietary polyphenols (DPs) have garnered growing interest because of their potent functional properties and health benefits. Nevertheless, the antioxidant capabilities of these substances are compromised by their multifarious structural compositions. Furthermore, most DPs are hydrophobic and unstable when subjected to light, heat, and varying pH conditions, restricting their practical application. Delivery systems based on the interactions of DPs with food constituents such as proteins, polypeptides, polysaccharides, and metal ions are being created as a viable option to improve the functional activities and bioavailability of DPs. In this review, the latest discoveries on the dietary sources, structureâ€“antioxidant activity relationships, and interactions with nutrients of DPs are discussed. It also innovatively highlights the application progress of polyphenols and their green nutraceutical delivery systems. The conclusion drawn is that the various action sites and structures of DPs are beneficial for predicting and designing polyphenols with enhanced antioxidant attributes. The metal complexation of polyphenols and green encapsulation systems display promising outcomes for stabilizing DPs during food processing and in vivo digestion. In the future, more novel targeted delivery systems of DPs for nutrient fortification and intervention should be developed. To expand their usage in customized food products, they should meet the requirements of specific populations for personalized food and nutrition.",
