        "abstract": "Glucosinolate (GLS) and phenolic contents in Brassicaceae contribute to biotic and abiotic stress responses. Breeding crop accessions harboring agroecologically relevant metabolic profiles require a characterization of the chemical diversity in Brassica germplasm. This work investigates the diversity of specialized metabolites in 281 accessions of B. napus. First, an LC-HRMS2-based approach allowed the annotation of 32 phenolics and 36 GLSs, revealing 13 branched and linear alkyl-GLSs and 4 isomers of hydroxyphenylalkyl-GLSs, many of which have been rarely reported in Brassica. Then, quantitative UPLC-UV-MS-based profiling was performed in leaves and roots for the whole panel. This revealed striking variations in the content of 1-methylpropyl-GLS (glucocochlearin) and a large variation of tetra- and penta-glucosyl kaempferol derivatives among accessions. It also highlighted two main chemotypes related to sinapoyl-O-hexoside and kaempferol-O-trihexoside contents. By offering an unprecedented overview of the phytochemical diversity in B. napus, this work provides a useful resource for chemical ecology and breeding",
